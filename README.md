## Description
  A website to play Fantasy Cross Country (like Fantasy Football, but with Cross Country Running). The frontend is made with React and the backend is a Java server made from scratch with websockets (although I did use a library to parse JSON). It stores data about meets and runners in the Postgres database provided by Heroku.
